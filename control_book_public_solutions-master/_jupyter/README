# Introduction

These notebooks have been prepared to follow the book and the python examples. 
They are designed to be used within [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

# Redering
To simply view the contents of the noteboooks, to see if they are worth your time, go ahead 
and open them in the Gitlab and they will render correctly


# Interaction
To interact with them clone the repository and upload them to your 
'Colab Notebooks' folder in Google Drive (you have had to visit Google Colab first, signed in, 
for that folder to show up). 

Once there, you can change values in code and run the examples.  

### Caveauts: 
 - The python API changed a bit after I first created these.  
 - These may require some edits before being fully functional.  
 - The animations I could never get to work within Colab.  
 - The animations do work when you use them on a local instance of jupyter notebooks. 
   - When run them on your own instance, don't use the "Prepare the Notebooks" sections
