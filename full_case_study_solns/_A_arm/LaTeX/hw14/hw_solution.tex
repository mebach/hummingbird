The single link robot arm is simulated using the following Python code.
\lstinputlisting[language=Python, caption=armSim.py]{../control_book_public_solutions/_a_arm/python/hw14/armSim.py}
Note that in this simulation, the uncertainty parameter is $\alpha=0.2$ implying $20\%$ variation in the plant parameters, and that the noise and disturbance are not zero.

A Python class that implements observer-based control with an integrator and disturbance observer for the single link robot arm is shown below.

Python code that computes the control gains is given below.
