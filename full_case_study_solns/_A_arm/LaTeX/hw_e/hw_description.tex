For the single link robot arm, use the PD gains derived in HW~\ref{ds:single_link_arm}.\ref{chap:PID-design-specs}. 
Add an integrator to the controller to get PID control.  
Put the resulting closed loop characteristic equation in Evan's form and use the Matlab {\tt rlocus} command to plot the root locus verses the integrator gain $k_I$.  Select a value for $k_I$ that does not significantly change the other locations of the closed loop poles.
