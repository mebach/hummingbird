The first step is to add a negative proportional gain of 1 to account for the negative sign in the plant transfer function. Once this is applied we can see that the phase of the plant alone is $-180$~deg over all frequencies. %so that the open loop response at low frequency is above $0$~dB.  
\fref{fig:hw_pendulum_compensator_in_design_2} shows the corresponding Bode plot for a proportional gain of $K=-1$.

	{fig:hw_pendulum_compensator_in_design_2}
We want the bandwidth of the inner loop to be approximately 40~rad/s and so we will set the crossover frequency to be 40 rad/s. To stabilize the system, we will add lead compensation centered at 40 rad/s with a lead ratio of 13.9 that corresponds to the desired phase margin of 60~deg.  \fref{fig:hw_pendulum_compensator_in_design_3} shows the addition of the phase-lead filter
\[
C_{lead} = -155.12\left( \frac{\frac{s}{10.72}+1}{\frac{s}{120}+1} \right),
\]
which has a phase margin of $PM=60$~degrees. The gain 155.12 sets the crossover frequency to be 40~rad/s. The lead compensation alone also satisfies the noise specification.

For the outer loop design, \fref{fig:hw_pendulum_compensator_out_design_1} shows the Bode plot of the plant $P=P_{out}\frac{P_{in}C_{in}}{1+P_{in}C_{in}}$ together with the design specification on reference tracking and noise attenuation.

We want a rise time of 2~sec for the system, so this leads us to select a crossover frequency of 1.1~rad/s. At 1.1~rad/s, the plant alone has a small negative phase margin (remember that 180~deg and $-180$~deg are equivalent), so to bring the phase margin up above 60~deg, we will use a lead compensator centered at 1.1~rad/s with a lead ratio of 32 to add 70~deg of phase. (A lead ratio of 32 is large. An alternative would be to add two leads that each contribute 35~deg of phase margin.) As shown in \fref{fig:hw_pendulum_compensator_out_design_2}, with the lead applied, the crossover frequency is pushed out beyond 100~rad/s. By applying a proportional gain of 0.0192, we set the crossover at 1.1~rad/s.
\controlbookfigurefullpage{0.7}
	{6_design_studies/figures/hw_pendulum_compensator_out_design_2}
	{The Bode plot for the outer loop system in HW~\ref{ds:pendulum}.\ref{chap:loopshaping_design}, with lead compensation and proportional gain.}
	{fig:hw_pendulum_compensator_out_design_2}
As can be seen from \fref{fig:hw_pendulum_compensator_out_design_2}, with the lead applied and crossover set at 1.1~rad/s, neither the tracking constraint nor the noise attenuation constraint is satisfied. We can satisfy the tracking constraint by applying lag compensation to boost the low-frequency gain near the constraint. Checking the gain of the lead compensated system at the tracking constraint frequency ($\omega_r$ = 0.0032~rad/s), we can see that the gain is too low by a factor of 4.8. Applying a lag compensator with a lag ratio of 8 ensures that this tracking constraint is satisfied as shown in \fref{fig:hw_pendulum_compensator_out_design_3}.

	{The Bode plot for the outer loop system in HW~\ref{ds:pendulum}.\ref{chap:loopshaping_design}, with lead, and lag control.}
	{fig:hw_pendulum_compensator_out_design_3}
%
Finally, we can apply a low-pass filter to reduce the effects of sensor noise in the system and satisfy the noise attenuation constraint. To satisfy the constraint, we need to drop the gain of the open-loop system by a factor of 2 at $\omega_{no}$ = 1000~rad/s. We can accomplish this with a low-pass filter with a cut-off frequency of 50~rad/s. This is shown in \fref{fig:hw_pendulum_compensator_out_design_4} below.

%
The resulting compensator is
\[
C_{out}(s) = 0.62\left(\frac{s+0.194}{s+6.24}\right)\left(\frac{s+0.0256}{s+0.0032}\right)\left( \frac{50}{s+50} \right).
\]
%\[
%C_{out}(s) = 0.50\left(\frac{s+0.194}{s+6.24}\right)\left(\frac{s+0.08}{s+0.01}\right)\left( %\frac{230}{s+230} \right).
%\]


The closed-loop response for both the inner and outer loop systems, 
as well as the unit-step response for the output and control signal of the outer loops, are all shows in \fref{fig:hw_pendulum_compensator_out_design_5}.

A prefilter
\[
F(s) = \frac{2}{s+2}
\]
has been added to the system. Note the significant decrease in the control effort required when prefiltering is used with the step input.
