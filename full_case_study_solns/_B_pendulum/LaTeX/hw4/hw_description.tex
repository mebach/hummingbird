For the inverted pendulum,
    \begin{description}
    \item[(a)] Find the equilibria of the system.
    \item[(b)] Linearize the system about the equilibria using Jacobian linearization.
    \end{description}
Note that for the inverted pendulum, since the nonlinearities are not all contained in the same channel as the control force $F$, the system cannot be feedback linearized.
