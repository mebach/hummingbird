 For the inverted pendulum:
  \begin{description}
    \item[(a)] Start with the linearized equations and use the Laplace transform to convert the equations of motion to the s-domain. 
    \item[(b)] Find the transfer functions from the input $\tilde{F}(s)$ to the outputs $\tilde{Z}(s)$ and $\tilde{\Theta}(s)$. Assume that the damping constant is negligible. How does this simplify the transfer functions? Is this a reasonable assumption?
    \item[(c)] From the simplified $\tilde{Z}(s)/\tilde{F}(s)$ and $\tilde{\Theta}(s)/\tilde{F}(s)$ transfer functions, compute the $\tilde{Z}(s)/\tilde{\Theta}(s)$ transfer function. Draw a block diagram of the system as a series of two transfer functions from $\tilde{F}(s)$ to $\tilde{\Theta}(s)$ and from $\tilde{\Theta}(s)$ to $\tilde{Z}(s)$.
    \item[(d)] Describe how this transfer-function cascade makes sense physically. How does force influence the pendulum angle? How does the pendulum angle influence the cart position?
  \end{description}
