 For the inverted pendulum:
  \begin{description}
    \item[(a)] Start with the linearized equations and use the Laplace transform to convert the equations of motion to the s-domain. 
    \item[(b)] Find the full transfer matrix from the input $\tilde{F}(s)$ to the outputs $\tilde{Z}(s)$ and $\tilde{\Theta}(s)$.  Identify the fast and slow subsystem.
    \item[(c)] Find an approximation to the system that is a cascade of a SISO fast system and a SISO slow system, and identify the disturbances that are being ignored.
    \item[(d)] Argue that the fast-slow cascade approximation makes sense physically.
  \end{description}
