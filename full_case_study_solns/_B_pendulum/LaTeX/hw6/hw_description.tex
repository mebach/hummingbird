Defining the states as $\tilde{x}=(\tilde{z},\tilde{\theta},\dot{\tilde{z}},\dot{\tilde{\theta}})^{\top}$, the input as $\tilde{u}=\tilde{F}$, and the measured output as $\tilde{y}=(\tilde{z},\tilde{\theta})^{\top}$, find the linear state space equations in the form
\begin{align*}
	\dot{\tilde{x}} &= A\tilde{x} + B\tilde{u} \\
	\tilde{y} &= C\tilde{x} + D\tilde{u}.
\end{align*}
