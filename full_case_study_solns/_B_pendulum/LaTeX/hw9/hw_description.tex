\item[]
\item[(a)] When the inner loop controller for the inverted pendulum is PD control, what is the system type with respect to tracking of the inner loop?  Characterize the steady state error when $\tilde{\theta}^r$ is a step, a ramp, and a parabola.  What is the system type with respect to an input disturbance?
\item[(b)] When the outer loop controller for the inverted pendulum is PD control, what is the system type of the outer loop with respect to tracking?  Characterize the steady state error when $z^r$ is a step, a ramp, and a parabola.  How does this change if you add an integrator?  What is the system type with respect to an input disturbance for both PD and PID control?
