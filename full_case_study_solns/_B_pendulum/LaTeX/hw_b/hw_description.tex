Modify the simulink model created in homework~\ref{ds:pendulum}.\ref{chap:animation} by creating an s-function that implements the equations of motion.  The input to the s-function should be a slider for force.  The output should go to the animation developed in homework~\ref{ds:pendulum}.\ref{chap:animation}.
