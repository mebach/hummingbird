The objective of this problem is to implement a state feedback controller using the full state.
Start with the simulation files developed in Homework~\ref{ds:satellite}.\ref{chap:PID-digital-implementation}.
\begin{description}
\item[(a)] Using the values for $\omega_{n_\phi}$, $\zeta_\phi$, $\omega_{n_{\theta}}$, and $\zeta_{\theta}$ selected in Homework~\ref{ds:satellite}.\ref{chap:PID-design-specs}, find the desired closed loop poles.  
\item[(b)] Add the state space matrices $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$ derived in Homework~\ref{ds:satellite}.\ref{chap:state_space_models} to your param file.
\item[(c)] Verify that the state space system is controllable by checking that $\text{rank}(\mathcal{C}_{A,B})=n$.
\item[(d)] Find the feedback gain $K$ so that the eigenvalues of $(A-BK)$ are equal to the desired closed loop poles.  Find the reference gain $k_r$ so that the DC-gain from $\phi_r$ to $\phi$ is equal to one.  
\item[(e)] Implement the state feedback scheme and tune the closed loop poles to get a good response.  You should be able to get a much faster response using state space methods.
