Suppose that a star tracker is used to measure $\theta$ and a strain gauge is used to approximate $\phi-\theta$.  
Defining the states as $x=(\theta,\phi,\dot{\theta},\dot{\phi})^{\top}$, the input as $u=\tau$, and the measured output as $y=(\theta,\phi-\theta)^{\top}$, find the linear state space equations in the form
\begin{align*}
	\dot{x} &= Ax + Bu \\
	y &= Cx + Du.
\end{align*}
