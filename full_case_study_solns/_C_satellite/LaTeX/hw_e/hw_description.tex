Adding an integrator to obtain PID control for the outer loop of the satellite system, put the characteristic equation in Evan's form and use the Matlab {\tt rlocus} command to plot the root locus verses the integrator gain $k_I$.  Select a value for $k_I$ that does not significantly change the other locations of the closed loop poles.
