\item[(a)] Modify your solution from HW~\ref{hw:mass}.\ref{chap:observers} so
that the uncertainty parameter is $\alpha=0.2$, representing 20\% inaccuracy in the knowledge of the system parameters, and so that the input disturbance is $0.25$. Also, add noise to the output channels $z_m$ and $\theta_m$ with standard deviation of $0.001$.  
\item[(b)] Add a disturbance observer to the controller, and verify that the steady state error in the estimator has been removed.  Tune the system to get good response.
