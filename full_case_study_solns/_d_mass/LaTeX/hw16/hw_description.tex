For the mass spring, use the \texttt{bode} command (from Python or Matlab) to create a graph that simultaneously displays the Bode plots for (1) the plant,  and (2) the plant under PID control, using the control gains calculated in Homework~\ref{hw:mass}.\ref{chap:PID-digital-implementation}. Use the dirty derivative when implementing the derivative portion of the PID control. 
\begin{description}
\item[(a)] What is the tracking error to a unit ramp under PID control? 
\item[(b)] If the frequency content of the input disturbance $d_{in}(t)$ is below $\omega_{d_{in}} = 0.1$ radians per second, what percentage of the input disturbance shows up in the output $z$ under PID control?
\item[(c)] If all of the frequency content of the noise $n(t)$ is greater than $\omega_{no} = 100$ radians per second, what percentage of the noise shows up in the output signal $z$?
