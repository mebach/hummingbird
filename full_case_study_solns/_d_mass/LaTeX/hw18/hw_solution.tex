From HW~\ref{hw:mass}.\ref{chap:transfer_function_models}, the transfer function model is
\[
\tilde{Z}(s) = \frac{\frac{1}{m}}{s^2+\frac{b}{m}s+\frac{k}{m}}\tilde{F}(s) \defeq P(s)\tilde{F}(s).
\]
Figure~\ref{fig:hw_mass_compensator_design_1} shows the Bode plot for $P$ together with the design specification on tracking and attenuating the noise.  The requirement to reject constant input disturbances requires the inclusion of an integrator which is not shown in Figure~\ref{fig:hw_mass_compensator_design_1}.

The first step is to add PI compensation to meet the requirement on rejecting input disturbances.  Figure~\ref{fig:hw_mass_compensator_design_2} shows the loop gain after adding the PI control
\[
C_{int} = \frac{s+0.2}{s}.
\]

Our goal is to cross over the system midway between the low and high frequency constraints. Let's choose $\omega_{co}$ = 7~rad/s. At this frequency, the PM is slightly negative. We will add 60~deg of PM to stabilize and add damping to the system. Figure~\ref{fig:hw_mass_compensator_design_3} shows the loopgain with the addition of the phase lead filter
\[
C_{lead} = \frac{s+1.88}{s+26.1},
\]
and the proportional gain $k_P=13.9$.

%Noise attenuation is enhanced by adding the low pass filter
%\[
%C_{lpf} = \frac{50}{s+50}
%\]
%and the result is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:hw_mass_compensator_design_4}.

Since the phase margin is $PM=59.2$~deg, we consider the phase margin specification to be satisfied.
The resulting compensator is
\[
C(s) = 903 \left(\frac{s+0.2}{s}\right)\left(\frac{s+1.88}{s+26.1}\right).
\]
The closed-loop response, 
as well as the unit-step response for the output and control signal are all show in Figure~\ref{fig:hw_mass_compensator_design_5}, where the prefilter
\[
F(s) = \frac{2}{s+2}
\]
has been added to reduce the peaking in the closed loop response.
