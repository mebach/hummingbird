\item[(a)]
Given the open loop transfer function from force to position in 
Homework~\ref{hw:mass}.\ref{chap:transfer_function_models}, find the open loop poles of the system, when the equilibrium position is $z_e=0$.
\item[(b)]
Using PD control architecture shown in Figure~\ref{fig:pid_PD_control_3}, find the closed loop transfer function from $z_r$ to $z$ and find the closed loop poles as a function of $k_P$ and $k_D$.
\item[(c)]  Select $k_P$ and $k_D$ to place the closed loop poles at $p_1=-1$ and $p_2=-1.5$.
\item[(d)] Using the gains from part (c), implement the PD control for the mass spring damper in simulation and plot the response of the system to a 1~m step input.
