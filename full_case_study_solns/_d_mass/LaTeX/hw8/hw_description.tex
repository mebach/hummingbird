For the mass spring, do the following:
\begin{description}

\item[(a)]  Suppose that the design requirements are that the rise time is
$t_r \approx 2$~seconds, with a damping ratio of $\zeta=0.7$.  Find the desired closed loop characteristic polynomial $\Delta_{cl}^d(s)$, and the associated pole locations. Find the proportional and derivative gains $k_P$ and $k_D$ to achieve these specifications, and modify the simulation from HW~\ref{hw:mass}.\ref{chap:PID-pole-placement} to verify that the step response satisfies the requirements.

\item[(b)] Suppose that the size of the input force is limited to $F_{\max}=6$~N.  Modify the simulation to include a saturation block on the force $F$.  Using the rise time $t_r$ as a tuning parameter, tune the PD control gains so that the input just saturates when a step of size of $1$~meter is placed on $z^r$. Plot the step response showing that saturation does not occur for a 1~meter step input for the new control gains.

\end{description}
