A rise time of $t_r\approx 2$ seconds, implies that the natural frequency is
\[
\omega_n = 2.2/2 = 1.1.
\]
Therefore, the desired characteristic polynomial is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:hwd8_1}
\Delta_{cl}^d = s^2 + 2\zeta\omega_n s + \omega_n^2 = s^2 + 1.54 s + 1.21.
\end{equation}
From HW~D.7 the actual closed loop characteristic polynomial is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:hwd8_2}
\Delta_{cl}(s) = s^2 + (0.1 + 0.2k_D)s + (0.6 + 0.2k_P).
\end{equation}
Equating Equations~\eqref{eq:hwd8_1} and~\eqref{eq:hwd8_2} and solving for the gains gives
\begin{align*}
k_P &=  3.05 \\
k_D &= 7.2.
\end{align*}

For the gains selected above, we can see that saturation does not occur if we limit the maximimum control force to be 6~N. By lowering the rise time requirement slightly, we get a higher proportional control gain. As it turns out, if $k_P$ is less than or equal to 6, saturation will not occur. For tuning your control design to avoid saturation, you can use a "guess and check" approach by varying the desired rise time and checking to see if saturation occurs in your simulation, or you can follow the more rigorous approach below.

Rather than using the rise time design requirement to choose the proportional gain $k_P$, the gain can instead be chosen using the saturation constraint. At the instant a step of 1~m is applied, there error will be 1~m. If the control force is limited to be 6~N, then the maximum value for the control gain is $k_P = 6$~N/m.

We must now find the value of $k_D$ to ensure $\zeta=0.7$. Recall that the characteristic polynomial for canonical second-order system is given by
\begin{equation} \label{eq:hwd8_3}
	\Delta_{\textrm{2nd}}(s) = s^2 + 2 \zeta \omega_n s + \omega_n^2 .
\end{equation}
%
Comparing coefficients of Equations~\eqref{eq:hwd8_3} and~\eqref{eq:hwd8_2}, we find that for $k_P=6$, $\omega_n=\sqrt{1.8}$~rad/s. Equating $s$ coefficients, we have
\[
	2(0.7)\sqrt{1.8} = 1.878 = 0.1+0.2 k_D , 
\]
giving $k_D = 8.89$.
