Modify the Simulink, Matlab, or Python model created in 
Homework~\ref{hw:mass}.\ref{chap:kinetic-energy} by creating a function that implements the equations of motion.  The input to the function should be a variable force.  The output should go to the animation developed in Homework~\ref{hw:mass}.\ref{chap:kinetic-energy}.
