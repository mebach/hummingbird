The objective of this problem is to implement a state feedback controller for the ball and beam problem.  
Start with the simulation files developed in Homework~\ref{hw:ballbeam}.\ref{chap:PID-digital-implementation}.
\begin{description}
%\item[(a)] Using the values for $\omega_{n_z}$, $\zeta_z$, $\omega_{n_{\theta}}$, and $\zeta_{\theta}$ selected in Homework~\ref{hw:ballbeam}.\ref{chap:PID-design-specs}, find the desired closed loop poles.  
\item[(a)] Using the values for $\omega_{n_z}$ and $\zeta_z$ from Homework~\ref{hw:ballbeam}.\ref{chap:PID-design-specs}, choose the desired locations of the four closed-loop poles so that their natural frequency is greater than $\omega_{n_z}$ and damping ratio is greater than $\zeta_z$. 
\item[(b)] Add the state space matrices $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$ derived in Homework~\ref{hw:ballbeam}.\ref{chap:state_space_models} to your param file.
\item[(c)] Verify that the state space system is controllable by checking that $\text{rank}(\mathcal{C}_{A,B})=n$.
\item[(d)] Find the feedback gain $K$ such that the eigenvalues of $(A-BK)$ are equal to the desired closed loop poles.  Find the reference gain $k_r$ so that the DC-gain from $z_r$ to $z$ is equal to one.  
\item[(e)] Implement the state feedback scheme in simulation and tune the closed-loop poles to vary the response of the system. Notice the effect of pole locations on the speed of response and the control effort required.
