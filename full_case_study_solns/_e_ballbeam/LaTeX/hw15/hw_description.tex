\item[(a)] Draw by hand the Bode plot of the inner loop transfer function from force $\tilde{F}$ to angle $\tilde{\theta}$ for the ball beam system.
Use the \texttt{bode} command from Matlab or Python and compare your results.
\item[(b)] Draw by hand the Bode plot of the outer loop transfer function from angle $\tilde{\theta}$ to position $\tilde{z}(t)$ for the ball beam system. Use the \texttt{bode} command and compare your results.
