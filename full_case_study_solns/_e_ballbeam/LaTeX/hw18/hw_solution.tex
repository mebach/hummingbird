The first step is to add a proportional gain so that the open loop response below $\omega_r=1$~radians/sec is above $20\log_{10}\gamma_r^{-1} = 50$~dB.  Figure~\ref{fig:hw_ballbeam_compensator_in_design_2} shows the corresponding Bode plot for a proportional gain of $k_p=150$.

To stabilize the system, a phase lead compensator needs to be added around the cross over frequency.  Figure~\ref{fig:hw_ballbeam_compensator_in_design_3} shows the addition of the phase lead filter
\[
C_{lead} = \frac{15(s+\frac{40}{\sqrt{15}})}{(s+\frac{40}{\sqrt{15}})},
\]
which has a phase margin of $PM=61$~degrees.

   \label{fig:hw_ballbeam_compensator_in_design_3}
\end{figure}
The noise specification is met by adding the low pass filter
\[
C_{lpf} = \frac{500}{s+500}
\]
as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:hw_ballbeam_compensator_in_design_4}.

\end{figure}
The compensator for the inner loop is given by
\[
C_{in}(s) = 150 \left(\frac{15(s+\frac{40}{\sqrt{15}})}{(s+\frac{40}{\sqrt{15}})}\right)\left(\frac{500}{s+500}\right).
\]
The closed loop response for the inner subsystem
\[
\frac{P_{in}C_{in}}{1+P_{in}C_{in}},
\] 
as well as the unit step response for the output and control signal are all show in Figure~\ref{fig:hw_ballbeam_compensator_in_design_5}.

For the outer loop design, Figure~\ref{fig:hw_ballbeam_compensator_out_design_1} shows the Bode plot of the plant $P=P_{out}\frac{P_{in}C_{in}}{1+P_{in}C_{in}}$ together with the design specification on reference tracking and noise attenuation.  To reject constant input disturbances, we need to add an integrator to the controller.

   \label{fig:hw_ballbeam_compensator_out_design_1}
\end{figure}
The first step is to add a negative proportional gain to lower the bandwidth to reduce the size of the control input.  The result is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:hw_ballbeam_compensator_out_design_2} where $k_p=-0.1$.
\begin{figure}[H]

   \label{fig:hw_ballbeam_compensator_out_design_2}
\end{figure}
To reject constant input disturbances, integral control is added.  Integral control is also used to satisfy the tracking specification.  
Figure~\ref{fig:hw_ballbeam_compensator_out_design_3}
shows the loopgain after adding
\[
C_{int} = \frac{s+0.3}{s}.
\]

   \label{fig:hw_ballbeam_compensator_out_design_3}
\end{figure}
Note that the phase margin is negative which implies that the closed loop system is currently unstable. 
To stabilize the system, a phase lead compensator needs to be added around the cross over frequency.  Figure~\ref{fig:hw_ballbeam_compensator_in_design_4} shows the addition of the phase lead filter
\[
C_{lead} = \frac{25(s+\frac{2}{\sqrt{25}})}{(s+\frac{2}{\sqrt{25}})},
\]
which results in a phase margin of $PM=59.8$~degrees.

   \label{fig:hw_ballbeam_compensator_out_design_4}
\end{figure}
To meet the noise specification, the low pass filter
\[
C_{lpf} = \frac{50}{s+50}
\]
is added to the compensator, and the resulting loopgain is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:hw_ballbeam_compensator_out_design_5}.
\begin{figure}[H]

   \label{fig:hw_ballbeam_compensator_out_design_5}
\end{figure}
The resulting compensator is
\[
C_{out}(s) = -0.1\left(\frac{s+0.3}{s}\right)\left(\frac{25(s+\frac{2}{\sqrt{25}})}{(s+\frac{2}{\sqrt{25}})}\right)\left(\frac{50}{s+50}\right).
\]
The closed loop response for both the inner and outer loop systems, 
as well as the unit step response for the output and control signal of the outer loops are all show in Figure~\ref{fig:hw_ballbeam_compensator_out_design_6}.
