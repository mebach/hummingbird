\begin{description}
\item[(a)] Using the configuration variables $z$ and $\theta$, write an expression for the kinetic energy of the system.  Assume that the ball is a point mass without rolling inertia.  In general, this term will be small and will not have a large effect on the dynamics of the ball-beam system.
\item[(b)] Create an animation of the ball on beam system. The inputs should be $z$ and $\theta$.  Turn in a screen capture of the animation.
