 For the ball on beam system:
  \begin{description}
    \item[(a)] Start with the linearized equations and use the Laplace transform to convert the equations of motion to the s-domain. 
    \item[(b)] Find the transfer functions from the input $\tilde{F}(s)$ to the outputs $\tilde{Z}(s)$ and $\tilde{\Theta}(s)$. Find the transfer function from the input $\tilde{\Theta}(s)$ to the output $\tilde{Z}(s)$.
    \item[(c)] Assume that deviations in the gravity torque away from the equilibrium torque due to motions of the ball along the beam are small compared to the torque required to hold up the beam. This will allow you to ignore the $m_1 g \tilde{z}$ term in the second equation of motion. How does this simplify your transfer functions? 
    \item[(d)] Draw a block diagram of your simplified system transfer functions in a cascade from the input $\tilde{F}(s)$ to the intermediate state $\tilde{\Theta}(s)$ and then to the output $\tilde{Z}(s)$ .
  \end{description}
