Adding an integrator to obtain PID control for the outer loop of the ballbeam system, put the characteristic equation in Evan's form and use the Matlab {\tt rlocus} command to plot the root locus verses the integrator gain $k_I$.  Note that since the integrator gain will be negative, the transfer function in Evan's form must be negated since the Matlab \texttt{rlocus} command only plots the return for $k_I>0$.  Select a value for $k_I$ that does not significantly change the other locations of the closed loop poles.
