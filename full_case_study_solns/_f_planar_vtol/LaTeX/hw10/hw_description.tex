The objective of this problem is to implement the PID controller using only measured outputs of the system.
\begin{description}
\item[(a)]  Modify the system dynamics file so that the parameters $m_c$, $J_c$, $d$, and $\mu$ vary by up to 20\% of their nominal value each time they are run (uncertainty parameter = 0.2).
\item[(b)]  Change the simulation files so that the input to the controller is the output and not the state.   Implement the nested PID loops in Problems~\ref{hw:vtol}.\ref{chap:PID-design-specs}.  Use the dirty derivative gain of $\tau=0.05$.  Tune the integrator so that there is no steady state error. The controller should only assume knowledge of the position $z$, the angle $\theta$, the altitude $h$, the reference position $z_r$, and the reference altitude $h_r$.
