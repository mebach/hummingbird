\item[(a)] Draw by hand the Bode plot of the altitude transfer function from force $\tilde{F}$ to altitude $\tilde{h}$.
Use the \texttt{bode} command (from Matlab or Python) and compare your results.
\item[(b)] Draw by hand the Bode plot of the inner loop transfer function for the lateral dynamics from torque $\tau$ to angle $\theta$. Use the \texttt{bode} command and compare your results.
\item[(c)] Draw by hand the Bode plot of the outer loop transfer function for the lateral dynamics from angle $\theta$ to position $z(t)$. Use the \texttt{bode} command and compare your results.
