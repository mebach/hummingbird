For this problem, use the gains found in Homework~\ref{hw:vtol}.\ref{chap:PID-digital-implementation}.
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)] For the altitude hold loop of the VTOL system, use the \texttt{bode} and \texttt{margin} commands (from Matlab or Python) to find the phase and gain margin for the closed loop system under PID control.  On the same graph, plot the open loop Bode plot and the closed loop Bode plot.  What is the bandwidth of the closed loop system, and how does this relate to the crossover frequency?  

\item[(b)]  For the inner loop of the lateral control loop, use the \texttt{bode} and \texttt{margin} commands to find the phase and gain margin for the inner loop system under PD control.  On the same graph, plot the open loop Bode plot and the closed loop Bode plot.  What is the bandwidth of the closed loop system, and how does this relate to the crossover frequency?

\item[(c)]  For the outer loop of the lateral control loop, use the \texttt{bode} and \texttt{margin} commands to find the phase and gain margin for the outer loop system under PD control.  Plot the open and closed loop Bode plots for the outer loop on the same plot as the open and closed loop for the inner loop.  What is the bandwidth of the closed loop system, and how does this relate to the crossover frequency?

\item[(d)]  What is the bandwidth separation between the inner (fast) loop, and the outer (slow) loop?  For this design, is successive loop closure justified?
\end{itemize}
