(a) From HW~\ref{hw:vtol}.\ref{chap:transfer_function_models}, the transfer function model is
\[
H(s) = \frac{\left(\frac{1}{m_c + 2 m_r}\right)}{s^2}\tilde{F}(s) = P_{lon}(s)\tilde{F}(s).
\]
Figure~\ref{fig:hw_vtol_lon_compensator_design_1} shows the Bode plot for $P_{lon}$ together with the design specification on tracking and attenuating the noise.  The requirement to reject constant input disturbances requires the inclusion of an integrator which is not shown in Figure~\ref{fig:hw_vtol_lon_compensator_design_1}.

   \label{fig:hw_vtol_lon_compensator_design_1}
\end{figure}

The first step is to add a phase lead element to stabilize the system.  Figure~\ref{fig:hw_vtol_lon_compensator_design_2} shows the loopgain with the addition of the phase lead filter
\[
C_{lead} = \frac{45(s+1/\sqrt{45})}{s+1/\sqrt{45}},
\]
and a proportional gain of $k_P=0.4$.

   \label{fig:hw_vtol_lon_compensator_design_2}
\end{figure}
To meet the requirement on rejecting input disturbances, an integrator is added, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:hw_vtol_lon_compensator_design_3} where
\[
C_{int} = \frac{s+0.5}{s}.
\]

   \label{fig:hw_vtol_lon_compensator_design_3}
\end{figure}
To meet the spec on noise attenuation, the low pass filter
\[
C_{lpf} = \frac{50}{s+50}
\]
and the result is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:hw_vtol_lon_compensator_design_4}.
\begin{figure}[H]

   \label{fig:hw_vtol_lon_compensator_design_4}
\end{figure}

Since the phase margin is $PM=52.7$~degrees, we consider the phase margin specification to be satisfied.
The resulting compensator is
\[
C(s) = 0.4\left(\frac{45(s+1/\sqrt{45})}{s+1/\sqrt{45}}\right)\left(\frac{s+0.5}{s}\right)\left(\frac{50}{s+50}\right).
\]
The closed loop response, 
as well as the unit step response for the output and control signal are all show in Figure~\ref{fig:hw_vtol_lon_compensator_design_5}, where the prefilter
\[
F(s) = \frac{1}{s+1}
\]
has been added to reduce the peaking in the closed loop response.

(b)
From HW~\ref{hw:vtol}.\ref{chap:transfer_function_models}, the transfer function model for the inner loop is
\[
\tilde{\Theta}(s) = \frac{\left(\frac{1}{a_2}\right)}{s^2}\tilde{\tau}(s) = P_{lat_{in}}(s)\tilde{\tau}(s).
\]
Figure~\ref{fig:hw_vtol_lat_in_compensator_design_1} shows the Bode plot for $P_{lat_{in}}$.

   \label{fig:hw_vtol_lat_in_compensator_design_1}
\end{figure}

To stabilize the system, we add a phase lead element around the cross-over frequency.  Figure~\ref{fig:hw_vtol_lat_in_compensator_design_2} shows the loopgain with the addition of the phase lead filter
\[
C_{lead} = \frac{15(s+8/\sqrt{15})}{s+8/\sqrt{15}}.
\]

   \label{fig:hw_vtol_lat_in_compensator_design_2}
\end{figure}
Since the bandwidth and phase margin specifications are satisfied, we complete the design by adding the low pass filter
\[
C_{lpf} = \frac{200}{s+200}
\]
and the result is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:hw_vtol_lat_in_compensator_design_3}.

\end{figure}
The resulting compensator is
\[
C(s) = \left(\frac{15(s+8/\sqrt{15})}{s+8\sqrt{15}}\right)\left(\frac{200}{s+200}\right).
\]
The closed loop response, 
as well as the unit step response for the output and control signal are all show in Figure~\ref{fig:hw_vtol_lat_in_compensator_design_4}.

(c)

From HW~\ref{hw:vtol}.\ref{chap:transfer_function_models}, the transfer function model is
\[
Z(s) = \frac{-\left(\frac{F_0}{a_1}\right)}{s^2 + \frac{\mu}{a_1}} \tilde{\Theta}(s) = P_{lat_{out}}(s)\tilde{\Theta}(s).
\]
Figure~\ref{fig:hw_vtol_lat_out_compensator_design_1} shows the Bode plot for $P_{lat_{out}}$ together with the design specification on attenuating the noise.  The requirement to reject constant input disturbances requires the inclusion of an integrator which is not shown in Figure~\ref{fig:hw_vtol_lat_out_compensator_design_1}.

   \label{fig:hw_vtol_lat_out_compensator_design_1}
\end{figure}

Since the gain of the open loop plant is negative, a negative proportional gain is needed to stabilize the system.  To place the cross over frequency at the correct location, a proportional gain of $k_P = -0.03$ is selected.  The resulting loop gain is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:hw_vtol_lat_out_compensator_design_2}

\end{figure}
To increase the phase margin, the phase lead element
\[
C_{lead} = \frac{45(s+1.3/\sqrt{45})}{s+1.3\sqrt{45}},
\]
is added, and the resulting loop gain is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:hw_vtol_lat_out_compensator_design_3}

\end{figure}

To meet the spec on noise attenuation, the low pass filter
\[
C_{lpf} = \frac{20}{s+20}
\]
and the result is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:hw_vtol_lat_out_compensator_design_5}.

Since the phase margin is $PM=52.7$~degrees, we consider the phase margin specification to be satisfied.

\[
C(s) = -0.03\left(\frac{45(s+1.3/\sqrt{45})}{s+1.3\sqrt{45}}\right)\left(\frac{s+0.4}{s}\right)\left(\frac{20}{s+20}\right).
