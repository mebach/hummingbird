    \item[(a)] Find the potential energy for the system.
    \item[(b)] Define the generalized coordinates and damping forces.
    \item[(c)] Find the generalized forces.  Note that the right and left forces are more easily modeled as a total force on the center of mass, and a torque about the center of mass.
    \item[(d)] Derive the equations of motion for the planar VTOL system using the Euler-Lagrange equations.
	\item[(e)] Referring to Appendices~\ref{chap:python}, \ref{chap:matlab}, and~\ref{chap:simulink}, write a class or s-function that implements the equations of motion.  Simulate the system using a variable force inputs $f_r$ and $f_\ell$.  The output should connect to the animation function developed in homework~\ref{hw:vtol}.\ref{chap:kinetic-energy}.
