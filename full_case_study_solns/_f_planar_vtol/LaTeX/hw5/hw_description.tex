For the planar VTOL system, note that the system naturally divides into so-called longitudinal dynamics (up-down motion) with total force $\tilde{F}$ as the input and altitude $\tilde{h}$ as the output, and lateral dynamics (side-to-side motion) with $\tilde{\tau}$ as the input and $\tilde{z}$ as the output, with $\tilde{\theta}$ as an intermediate variable.

  \begin{description}
    \item[(a)] Start with the linearized equations of motion and use the Laplace transform to convert the equations of motion to the s-domain. 
    \item[(b)] For the longitudinal dynamics, find the transfer function from the input $\tilde{F}(s)$ to the output $\tilde{H}(s)$.
    \item[(c)] For the lateral dynamics, find the transfer function from the input $\tilde{\tau}(s)$ to the intermediate state $\tilde{\Theta}(s)$ and the output $\tilde{Z}(s)$. Find the transfer function from $\tilde{\Theta}(s)$ to $\tilde{Z}(s)$.
    \item[(d)] Draw a block diagram of the open loop longitudinal and lateral systems.
  \end{description}
