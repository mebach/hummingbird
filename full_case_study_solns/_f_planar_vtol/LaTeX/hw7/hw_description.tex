For this problem we will only consider the longitudinal (up-down) dynamics of the VTOL system.  
\begin{description}
\item[(a)]
Given the open-loop transfer function from total force $\tilde{F}$ to altitude $\tilde{h}$ found in homework~~\ref{hw:vtol}.\ref{chap:transfer_function_models}, find the open-loop poles of the system.
\item[(b)]
Using PD control architecture shown in Figure~\ref{fig:pid_PD_control_3}, find the closed-loop transfer function from $\tilde{h}_r$ to $\tilde{h}$ and find the closed-loop poles as a function of $k_P$ and $k_D$.
\item[(c)]  Select $k_P$ and $k_D$ to place the closed-loop poles at $p_1=-0.2$ and $p_2=-0.3$.
\item[(d)] Using the gains from part (c), implement the PD control for the altitude control in simulation and plot the step response.
