\item[(a)] When the longitudinal controller for the VTOL system is PD control, what is the system type? Characterize the steady state error when $h^d$ is a step, a ramp, and a parabola.  How does this change if you add an integrator?  What is the system type with respect to an input disturbance for both PD and PID control? 
\item[(b)] When the inner loop of the lateral controller for the VTOL system is PD control, what is the system type of the inner loop?  Characterize the steady state error when $\tilde{\theta}^d$ is a step, a ramp, and a parabola.  What is the system type with respect to an input disturbance?
\item[(c)] When the outer loop of the lateral controller for the VTOL system is PD control, what is the system type of the outer loop?  Characterize the steady state error when $z^d$ is a step, a ramp, and a parabola.  How does this change if you add an integrator?  What is the system type with respect to an input disturbance for both PD and PID control?
