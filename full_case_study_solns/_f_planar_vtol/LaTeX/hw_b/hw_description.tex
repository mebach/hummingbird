Modify the Simulink, Matlab, or Python model created in
homework~\ref{hw:vtol}.\ref{chap:kinetic-energy} by creating a function that implements the
equations of motion.  The input to the function should be
a slider for the forces $f_r$ and $f_\ell$.  The output should go to the
animation developed in homework~F.a.  The target is still maneuvered using a slider bar.
