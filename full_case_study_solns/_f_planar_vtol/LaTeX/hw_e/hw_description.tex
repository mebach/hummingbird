\item[(a)]Adding an integrator to obtain PID control for the longitudinal controller for the VTOL system, put the characteristic equation in Evan's form and use the Matlab/Python {\tt rlocus} command to plot the root locus verses the integrator gain $k_{I_h}$.  Select a value for $k_{I_h}$ that does not significantly change the other locations of the closed loop poles.  \item[(b)]
Adding an integrator to obtain PID control for the outer loop of the lateral controller for the VTOL system, put the characteristic equation of the outer loop in Evan's form and use the Matlab/Python {\tt rlocus} command to plot the root locus verses the integrator gain $k_{I_z}$.  Select a value for $k_{I_z}$ that does not significantly change the other locations of the closed loop poles.
