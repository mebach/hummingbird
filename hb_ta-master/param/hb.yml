# The Hummingbird is boken down into three parts.
# 1) Bird: the head, rotors, and rolling shaft
# 2) Arm assempbly: the pitching body
# 3) Yaw Turning Block Assembly: the portion of the hummingbird that yaws
# The numbers on the parameters indicate which part they are associated with.
# Ex l1 is a length associated with the Bird.
# When the roll pitch and yaw angles are all zero, the position of the center
# of mass of m1 is (l1,0,0)', the position of the center of mass of m2 is
# (l2,0,0)', and the position of the center of amss of m3 is (l3x,l3y,l3z)'.
# The distance from the center of rotation to the head is lT and the distance
# from the cneter of the head to the rotors is d
